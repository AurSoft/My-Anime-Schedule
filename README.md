My Anime Schedule is a simple app to help you keeping up with the world of anime!

Many anime are aired every week and it can be difficult to keep up with all the good series, so wouldn't be nice to have a friendly reminder when your favorite show starts?

With My Anime Schedule this becomes pretty simple: in your home page, you can filter what anime get aired daily (starting from today). You can then see more infos by clicking on one of them. Then, if its description gets your interest, you can click on the watch icon to be notified when a new episode it's airing.

And if you get bored of an anime, you can just unfollow it!

Pretty simple, huh?
